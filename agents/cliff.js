To enhance the Cliff agent with memory tracking, we need to modify the agent's behavior to keep track of its past actions and states. This can be useful for various purposes, such as learning from past experiences, avoiding repeated mistakes, or making more informed decisions.

Here's a step-by-step guide to enhancing the Cliff agent with memory tracking:

1. **Define the Memory Structure**: We need a structure to store the agent's past states, actions, and rewards.
2. **Update the Memory**: Each time the agent takes an action, we should update the memory with the current state, action, and reward.
3. **Use Memory for Decision Making**: The agent can use the memory to make decisions, such as avoiding states it has previously encountered with negative rewards.

Let's assume the Cliff agent is implemented using a simple Q-learning approach. We will enhance this agent to include memory tracking.

### Step 1: Define the Memory Structure

We will use a list to store tuples of (state, action, reward).

```python
class CliffAgent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate, discount_factor, exploration_rate):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.discount_factor = discount_factor
        self.exploration_rate = exploration_rate
        self.q_table = {}
        self.memory = []

    def get_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.exploration_rate:
            return random.choice(self.get_possible_actions(state))
        else:
            return self.get_best_action(state)

    def get_possible_actions(self, state):
        # Return a list of possible actions for the given state
        return [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Example actions: up, down, left, right

    def get_best_action(self, state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(state)}
        return max(self.q_table[state], key=self.q_table[state].get)

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(state)}
        if next_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[next_state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(next_state)}
        
        best_next_action = self.get_best_action(next_state)
        td_target = reward + self.discount_factor * self.q_table[next_state][best_next_action]
        td_error = td_target - self.q_table[state][action]
        self.q_table[state][action] += self.learning_rate * td_error

    def update_memory(self, state, action, reward):
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward))

    def use_memory(self):
        # Example: Avoid states with negative rewards
        for state, action, reward in self.memory:
            if reward < 0:
                if state not in self.q_table:
                    self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(state)}
                self.q_table[state][action] -= 1  # Penalize the action that led to a negative reward
```

### Step 2: Update the Memory

We will update the memory each time the agent takes an action and receives a reward.

```python
def step(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
    self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
    self.update_memory(state, action, reward)
```

### Step 3: Use Memory for Decision Making

We will use the memory to update the Q-table and avoid actions that led to negative rewards.

```python
def step(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
    self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
    self.update_memory(state, action, reward)
    self.use_memory()
```

### Complete Enhanced Cliff Agent

Here is the complete enhanced Cliff agent with memory tracking:

```python
import random

class CliffAgent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate, discount_factor, exploration_rate):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.discount_factor = discount_factor
        self.exploration_rate = exploration_rate
        self.q_table = {}
        self.memory = []

    def get_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.exploration_rate:
            return random.choice(self.get_possible_actions(state))
        else:
            return self.get_best_action(state)

    def get_possible_actions(self, state):
        # Return a list of possible actions for the given state
        return [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Example actions: up, down, left, right

    def get_best_action(self, state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(state)}
        return max(self.q_table[state], key=self.q_table[state].get)

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(state)}
        if next_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[next_state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(next_state)}
        
        best_next_action = self.get_best_action(next_state)
        td_target = reward + self.discount_factor * self.q_table[next_state][best_next_action]
        td_error = td_target - self.q_table[state][action]
        self.q_table[state][action] += self.learning_rate * td_error

    def update_memory(self, state, action, reward):
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward))

    def use_memory(self):
        # Example: Avoid states with negative rewards
        for state, action, reward in self.memory:
            if reward < 0:
                if state not in self.q_table:
                    self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in self.get_possible_actions(state)}
                self.q_table[state][action] -= 1  # Penalize the action that led to a negative reward

    def step(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
        self.update_memory(state, action, reward)
        self.use_memory()
```

This enhanced Cliff agent now includes memory tracking, which can help it learn from past experiences and make more informed decisions.
